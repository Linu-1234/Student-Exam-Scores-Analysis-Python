# Student-Exam-Scores-Analysis-Python
This project aims to analyze student exam scores using Python to identify patterns, insights, and actionable outcomes.

## Project Objective
The objective is to understand the factors influencing student performance and to visualize these insights in an impactful manner.

## Tools Used
- Kaggle: The dataset for the analysis was sourced from Kaggle, a platform for sharing and discovering data and code.
- Python (Jupyter Notebook): For data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization.
- Canva: Utilized for designing and presenting visual insights effectively.

## Steps Involved
1. Data Acquisition:
- The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle, ensuring it was relevant and comprehensive for the analysis.
2. Data Preprocessing:
- Handled missing values.
- Normalized and cleaned data for accurate analysis.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Visualized data distributions and trends using Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Examined correlations between variables such as study hours, attendance, and scores.
4. Visualization:
- Created engaging visuals using Canva to represent insights in a clear and aesthetically pleasing manner.
5. Interpretation:
- Drew meaningful conclusions from the analysis to suggest strategies for improving student outcomes.

## Insights
- The number of females in the data is more than the number of males.
- Eduaction of the parents have a good impact on the students' score.
- Marital status of the parents have negligible impact on the students' score.
- Students are comparatively weak in maths than reading and writing.
- Ethnic group C  has more count than other groups.

## Conclusion
- The analysis reveals that study habits and parental education significantly impact student performance, while marital status has negligible influence.
-  Addressing weaknesses in math and leveraging insights about gender and ethnic representation can guide targeted strategies for improvement.
